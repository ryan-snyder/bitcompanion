## Tech stuff

All payments converted into fiat (not really but essentially)

### How it works

User adds existing wallet or creates a new wallet -> User can then add credit card/bank account/paypal/etc if wanted -> A "card" is generated with their "funds" associated -> can buy stuff using "card"

### What is a "card"

A "card" is a combination of funds from different crypto/cash. User can specify how much of each they want in it and what to use
Think of it as paypal but with crypto/cash

Whenever a user purchases something with the card whether through app (contactless) or online), the funds are sent (whatever currency it may be) and cost is subtracted from whatever currency you used (plus small fee)


Essentially, a Bitcompanion card is a wallet on the blockchain, however when you pay with this wallet it is always based off of fiat (maybe),
still decentralized, and secure.

Protocol for Allowing Crypto Payments Anywheres (or PACPA)

Whitepaper?

Gist is that a key problem with crypto is that you can't use crypto everywheres, and as such somewheres down the line crypto is always going to be converted into fiat.
This is a problem as when crypto is sold, the value drops which makes crypto prices flucuate
So we leverage the value of a crypto against actual fiat? Existing solutions that we can use with this dapp?
Make our own crypto?
One "Coin" equals One "fiat"
convert crypto to this "coin" and use for payments.

PCC? (Protocol for Converting Crypto)



What happens when a crypto is converted?
For example:
Converting Bitcoin to Eth -> X amount of Bitcoin is conveted into Y amount of Etherum
Let's say that 1 bitcoin equals 10 dollars and 1 etherum equals 5 dollars
If we want to convert 2 bitcoin into etherum the following happens:
We convert 2 bitcoin into fiat (in this case, 2 bitcoin equals 20 fiat), we then "buy" 20 fiat worth of etherum, which gives us 4 etherum

What happens on the blockchain?
We will define a transaction as an exchange between a sender and a receipent (note that this do not have to be actual wallets/people)
Using the above example, when the sender sends 2 bitcoin, those two bitcoin are "released" back into the blockchain, and the sender then takes 2 bitcoin worth of etherum from the blockchain
How does this affect prices? Not sure

Uses TrueUSD

Every transaction is converted into TrueUSD which is then converted into the Transaction currency which is used in purchase
